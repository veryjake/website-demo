    <h1>WELCOME TO MY WEBPAGE</h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="container">This is not my <em>first</em> web page, I have done many over the years. I started learning in middle school, but feel out of love during highschool. It was during COVID that I took interest again. I worked myself through <strong>freecodecamp.org.</strong> It was super cool to work through the lessons. Eventually I started messing with my computers shell and got into linux. It's been fun, but I'm pretty rusty, so this course should be a good refresher.</p>
